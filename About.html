			<h1>WHO WE ARE</h1><br>
			<p>We, Group Three, are a group of web designers of the Tay Tung High School Batch of 2022.
			Taught by our one and only amazing ICT teacher, sir Clyde Santes, we have created this website
			using the knowledge we have acquired from attending our classes, as well as researching on more
			ways on how we can make an enjoyable and attractive website. We are greatly privileged to have
			had the opportunity to learn about Web Design during our stay here in Tay Tung. In this page, we
			will introduce ourselves tell you more about who worked behind the scenes of making Istacion.</p>

				<h1>INGRID SECUELAN (施亚娜)</h1>
				<p>I particularly chose Web Design for ICT because I believe that it would<br>
				help me learn how to code and improve my skills in graphic design as well.<br>
				 I don't regret ever having taken this course and I can say that, although I had my to stay
				up late at night to finish my projects, seeing the beautiful results made me so happy and satisfied.
				Now that it's my last year in Tay Tung, I'm so grateful to have had the opportunity to know how to design websites
				and enjoy it along the process.</p>

				<h1>AJ PALO (叶丹)</h1>
				<p>I chose web design because it was the one that appealed the most to me, though I barely knew
				anything about coding and all when I started and chose this subject, I’m glad to say that I will
				be graduating the tenth grade with the knowledge that I know the basics of HTML and CSS. I am grateful
				to sir Clyde because he has given us all a chance to learn something completely alien to us but he was
				able to break it down into certain sections by which we were eventually able to understand completely.</p>

				<h1>NATT CALIPUSAN (苏磊)</h1>
				<p>I chose web design because I wanted to learn designing webpages and<br>websites. At first, I thought web design
				was all about digital arts, but little did<br>I know that it included coding. I was more interested in web design when I
				knew that it was all about coding and eventually I was having fun learning it. I experienced difficulties, but it was
				all a good experience all in all.</p>

				<h1>RAFAEL LEDESMA (汤伟)</h1>
				<p>I chose web design because I wanted to learn something new and challenging. At first, I thought
				Web Design was only about design, but I didn't know that it involved coding. I absolutely know nothing
				about coding, how to properly make a website, and making codes work. My experience throughout the whole
				Web Design class was fun, but there were times that I was stressed out because I'm not that good and
				skilled at coding. However, it was still fun to know about the elements and the proper way of coding
				websites.It's a new learning experience that I will not forget. What a great school year.</p>

				<h1>RICHARD TAN (郑文仁)</h1>
				<p>I chose web design because I'd like to explore new things that I've never tried before and I have no regrets of picking
				web design because it gives me challenge all the time of coding, I'm glad that I'm graduating from jhs and learning html
				and css aswell from it, all regards to sir Clyde for becoming our ict teacher for grade 10 he gives so much effort to us
				students that are willing to learn under from his subject.</p>
