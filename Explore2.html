				<h1>STATION 3</h1><br>
				<p>"We were a little lost. New teachers, new faces, and a completely new<br>
				phase of our lives. We were getting out of elementary school.
				<span style="font-style: italic;">Could<br>this be the end of our childhood?</span>
				Everyone was always telling us how<br>
				hard it would be and how it would be the best years of our lives. They<br>
				kept on telling us to study hard, yet never forget to seize the moment<br>
				and enjoy. We did just that and we cannot be more pleased with the<br>
				results."

				<p>"Eighth grade, we experienced so much. We became more mature, friendships<br>
				&nbsp between both sexes became more common and malice is rarely given to them.<br>
				&nbsp &nbsp Issues became unpopular, and we were actually united with one another<br>
				&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp and we enjoyed it. People became more participative and we were<br>
				&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp delighted to work on school activities together, it was our way<br>
				&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp of bonding. We enjoyed that year so much and we are holding<br>
				&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp on to those memories because little did we know, that the 2<br>
				&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  week break that we were so eager for, would become 2 long<br>
				&nbsp &nbsp years of not seeing each other." &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp

					<p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp "We all felt like we were all alone, taking our classes in front of blue-light<br>
					&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp emmitting screens, while cramped up in our rooms. We all felt stressed and<br>
					wanted to quit, but we didn't. We persevered, we rose up above the situation and we<br>
					chose to overcome everything. In doing these, we have found a variety of ways to overcome.<br>
					Not only did we overcome, but we have been able to meet a completely different version of<br>
					ourselves-- a newer and improved version. So, yes, this year started out differently than what<br>
					we were used to, but in the end, we still won and got something valuable that we never could've<br>
					gotten if it weren't for those cloudy days in the beginning. Everything happens for a reason." &nbsp - Palo, 2022</p>

					<h1>STATION 6</h1><br>
				    <p>The last year of junior high-- tenth grade. There were several moments where we were<br>
					able to bond together such as the graduation pictorial, and the iConnect, and we're so<br>
					grateful for such experiences since, although we don't have many memories together, we<br>
					have these kind of memories that we chose to savor and cherish. We've always wanted<br>
					this year to go by quickly because we were so tired and all, but we've never expected<br>
					how fast this year went by. We've learned a lot this year. We have matured so much and<br>
					we actually enjoyed learning this year. It's a shame that all of this will come to an<br>
					end and we have no choice to move on, but such is life." &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - Palo, 2022</p>
